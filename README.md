# To-Do-List


## Inspiration
The theme of this event was "In the Last Minute," and the first thing that was brought to our minds was the to do list.Unlike other to do list, our to do list features a timer that counts down to when the assignment is due. These assignments are picked by the user and is classified as "urgent". By doing so,it lets the user know how much time you have left before you have to hand it in. Creating a simple to do list website allows us to keep track of all the deadlines for different classes while also being reminded how much time you have left.

## What it does
A simple to do list that organizes the list of tasks either based off due dates or organized by classes. There are motivational quotes on the side of the webpage to motivate users to finish their assignments. Users can add homework assignmnets and their due dates to keep track of when its due. With a timer in place, users can see all the assignments due at one place while also seeing excatly how much time is left to do the assignment. 

## How we built it
-Built using react.js

## Challenges we ran into
-Setting up the front end and the learning curve of using react.js
-Complex coding errors


## Accomplishments that we're proud of
-With our group being fairly new to front end development the hurdle of learning how to use certain tools such as react was rather difficult. React.js was also something new to us so the learning curve slowed us down in the long run

## What we learned
-learning how to use react.js for the first time
-Creating a UI design using figma to design and prototype the website page 

## What's next 
We hope that with the new profound skills that weâ€™ve gained developing this project, that we will be able to improve and build something better for next time
